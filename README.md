# Footsie

Footsie is a configurable 16-bit DAC foot pedal controller designed for smooth analog speed control.

It uses an analog slide potentiometer as the pedal position input, reads that position with an ADC, applies a configurable response curve, and outputs a filtered analog control voltage using a 16-bit I²C DAC.

**Footsie is currently a work-in-progress.**

## Why?

I originally built Footsie for a pottery / ceramics wheel I made for my wife. The commercially available foot pedals I tried were not quite right: low-speed control was poor, the pedal travel was not used effectively, and the response did not feel natural.

Footsie exists to solve that problem.

The goal is to provide a foot pedal that can be tuned to behave exactly how you want, especially where fine low-speed control matters.

Yes, this is absolutely overkill.

Just the way i like it.

## Features

* Analog slide potentiometer pedal input
* Configurable input-to-output response curve
* Smooth filtered output voltage
* 16-bit DAC output controlled over I²C
* Return-to-zero DAC fail-safe behaviour
* Designed for applications where precise foot control is important

## How it works

1. The firmware reads the pedal position from the slide potentiometer using the ADC.
2. The raw input value is mapped through a configurable response curve.
3. The transformed value is filtered to produce a smooth output.
4. The result is sent to a 16-bit DAC over I²C.
5. The DAC outputs an analog control voltage for the connected motor controller or device.
6. If communication or control fails, the DAC output returns to zero as a fail-safe.

## Purpose

Footsie is not intended to be a universal motor controller. It is a configurable analog control pedal intended to replace or improve simple potentiometer-style foot pedals like you would find on an e-bike or sewing machine, particularly where the stock pedal response is too abrupt, too compressed, or poorly matched to the device being controlled.

**Possible Use Cases:**
- Pottery / ceramics wheels
- Small motor speed control systems
- Sewing machine-style speed pedals
- E-bike-style throttle signal replacement or testing
- Variable analog control inputs
- Custom machine controls
- Any project where a nicer foot-controlled analog voltage is useful

Check the requirements of the device being controlled before connecting Footsie. Not all pedal inputs or throttle inputs are electrically compatible.

## 🔩 Hardware Components

### Power

### ESP32-S3 Microprocessor

* Dual-core Xtensa LX7 @ up to 240 MHz.
* 512 KB SRAM + 384 KB ROM (on-chip) + 8MB PSRAM on module.
* Integrated Wi-Fi 4 (802.11 b/g/n) + Bluetooth 5 (LE).
* USB-C OTG support for power, firmware updates, etc.
* Deep sleep as low as ~5 µA.

### DAC

### Slide Potentiometer

## ✅ TODO

- [ ] Add web/app interface for configuration
- [ ] Add enclosure / pedal mechanical details

The intended configuration options include:

- Pedal minimum input
- Pedal maximum input
- Output minimum voltage
- Output maximum voltage
- Start dead zone
- End dead zone
- Response curve shape
- Filtering / smoothing amount
- Fail-safe behaviour
- Saved profiles

The long-term goal is to make these configurable through a web or app interface, rather than requiring firmware changes for every adjustment.
