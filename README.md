# Footsie

Footsie is a configurable foot pedal controller built around an ESP32-S3, a slide potentiometer input, and a 16-bit DAC80501 output over I2C.

It reads pedal position, applies a tunable response curve, smooths the input, and outputs an analog control voltage for a connected machine or controller.

## Why?

I originally built Footsie for a pottery / ceramics wheel I made for my wife. The commercially available foot pedals I tried were not quite right: low-speed control was poor, the pedal travel was not used effectively and the response did not feel natural.

Footsie exists to solve that problem.

The goal is to provide a foot pedal that can be tuned to behave exactly how you want, especially where fine low-speed control matters.

Yes, this is absolutely overkill.

Just the way i like it.

## Features

- Analog slide potentiometer pedal input on ADC channel 2 (GPIO3)
- Continuous ADC sampling with averaging and clamped calibration range
- Configurable gamma response curve, persisted in NVS
- Configurable ADC calibration min/max (mV), persisted in NVS
- Configurable output scaling min/max (mV), persisted in NVS
- 16-bit DAC80501 I2C output stage
- Fail-safe zero-output behavior when ADC/DAC mapping is invalid
- WS2812 status LED feedback
- Custom BLE GATT service for live telemetry and configuration

## Purpose

Footsie is not a full motor controller. It is a configurable analog control pedal intended to replace or improve simple potentiometer-style pedals where default response is poorly matched to the application.

**Possible Use Cases:**
- Pottery / ceramics wheels
- Small motor speed control systems
- Sewing machine-style speed pedals
- E-bike-style throttle signal replacement or testing
- Variable analog control inputs
- Custom machine controls
- Any project where a nicer foot-controlled analog voltage is useful

Check the requirements of the device being controlled before connecting Footsie. Not all pedal inputs or throttle inputs are electrically compatible.

## Hardware

Footsie currently uses these major components:

* ESP32-S3 microcontroller
* DAC80501 16-bit DAC over I2C
* Slide potentiometer as the pedal input
* WS2812B RGB LED for status indication

### Pin Map

The current firmware pin assignments are:

| Function | GPIO |
| --- | --- |
| I2C SDA | 1 |
| I2C SCL | 2 |
| ADC input | 3 |
| RGB LED | 21 |
| UART0 TX | 43 |
| UART0 RX | 44 |

## Firmware Defaults

## BLE Interface

Footsie advertises with device name Footsie and exposes one custom 128-bit service.

Service UUID:

- 4a8c0000-6d79-879d-184b-4b769c5b1e50

Characteristics:

| Characteristic | UUID | Access | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gamma | 4a8c0001-6d79-879d-184b-4b769c5b1e50 | Read/Write | u16, gamma x100 (220 = 2.20) |
| ADC calibration | 4a8c0003-6d79-879d-184b-4b769c5b1e50 | Read/Write | two u16 values: min_mV, max_mV |
| Output scaling | 4a8c0004-6d79-879d-184b-4b769c5b1e50 | Read/Write | two u16 values: min_mV, max_mV |
| ADC mV | 4a8c0002-6d79-879d-184b-4b769c5b1e50 | Read/Notify | u16 latest averaged ADC mV |

Behavior notes:

- Gamma write range: 0.50 to 5.00
- ADC calibration requires min < max and max <= 3300
- Output scaling requires min < max and max <= 5000
- Advertising restarts automatically after disconnect/adv-complete
- If a client disables ADC notifications, firmware terminates that BLE connection

## Configuration and Persistence

The following values are stored in NVS and survive reboot:

- Gamma
- ADC calibrated min and max (mV)
- Output scaling min and max (mV)

If values are missing or invalid in NVS, firmware falls back to compile-time defaults.

## Status LED

The WS2812 LED indicates runtime state:

- Green intensity tracks applied DAC output level
- Blue is lit while BLE is connected
- Startup briefly shows green when initialization completes

## Build, Flash, Monitor

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF installed (project currently tested with ESP-IDF 6.x toolchains)
- Target set to ESP32-S3
- Serial access to your board (Linux users may need dialout/uucp group membership)

### Fast Path (script)

From repository root:

./run.sh

The script:

- Initializes ESP-IDF environment if needed
- Runs idf.py build
- Runs idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor

Defaults and overrides:

- Default port: /dev/ttyACM0
- Override port: PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 ./run.sh
- Default ESP-IDF export path: $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
- Override export path: ESP_IDF_EXPORT_SH=$HOME/.espressif/v6.0.1/esp-idf/export.sh ./run.sh

### Manual Path

If you prefer direct commands:

1. Source your ESP-IDF environment.
2. From repository root, run:

idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor

## Development Notes

- ADC sampling and control output run in separate FreeRTOS tasks
- Control loop drives DAC to zero when input is invalid
- Mapping telemetry is rate-limited and change-triggered
- BLE housekeeping runs periodically and handles stale connection behavior

## Troubleshooting

- ESP-IDF not found:
	- Set ESP_IDF_EXPORT_SH to your local export.sh path, or initialize IDF in your shell before running the script.
- Serial port busy or missing:
	- Verify the board port and update PORT.
- Permission denied on serial device:
	- Add your user to the proper serial-access group and re-login.
